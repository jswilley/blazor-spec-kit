# Feature Specification: Basic Blazor Museum Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-basic-blazor-museum`  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Set up basic Blazor Museum client and API foundation with authentication"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Application Foundation Setup (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need a basic Blazor WebAssembly client and C# Minimal API server foundation so that I can build museum features on top of a secure, properly configured base application.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational requirement that enables all other museum features. Without proper architecture setup, no subsequent features can be implemented according to the constitutional requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the application starts, serves the Blazor WASM client, provides API endpoints with proper authentication configuration, and follows the architectural constraints defined in the constitution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I navigate to the root URL, **Then** the Blazor WebAssembly client loads successfully
2. **Given** the API is running, **When** I request the Swagger documentation, **Then** API endpoints are documented and accessible
3. **Given** the application is configured, **When** I check the project structure, **Then** it follows the Client/Server/Shared model architecture

---

### User Story 2 - JWT Authentication Foundation (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need JWT Bearer authentication configured in the API so that I can protect endpoints and implement role-based access control for museum administrators and users.

**Why this priority**: Security is a core principle in the constitution, and authentication is required before any museum data can be managed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying JWT token validation is configured, authentication middleware is properly set up, and endpoints can be protected with authorization attributes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the API is configured with JWT authentication, **When** I make a request without a token to a protected endpoint, **Then** I receive a 401 Unauthorized response
2. **Given** the authentication system is configured, **When** I check the middleware setup, **Then** UseAuthentication() and UseAuthorization() are properly configured

---

### User Story 3 - Basic Project Structure (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need the proper solution structure with Client, Server, and Shared projects so that I can maintain clean separation of concerns and follow the constitutional architecture.

**Why this priority**: Proper project structure ensures maintainability and follows the architectural constraints defined in the constitution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the three-project structure exists, shared DTOs are accessible from both client and server, and the solution builds successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the solution structure is created, **When** I examine the projects, **Then** I see separate Client (Blazor WASM), Server (Minimal API), and Shared (DTOs) projects
2. **Given** the projects are configured, **When** I build the solution, **Then** all projects compile successfully with proper references

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Blazor WASM client fails to load or connect to the API?
- How does the system handle invalid JWT tokens or expired authentication?
- What occurs when required configuration settings are missing from appsettings.json?
- How does the application behave when SQLite database file is missing or corrupted?
- What happens when API versioning conflicts occur between client and server?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Blazor WebAssembly client that runs in the browser
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a C# Minimal API server (.NET 9 or above) that hosts client files and provides protected endpoints
- **FR-003**: System MUST include a shared library containing all Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used by both Client and Server
- **FR-004**: System MUST use C# record types for all request/response data models
- **FR-005**: System MUST configure JWT Bearer Authentication on the server
- **FR-006**: System MUST support role-based authorization with "MuseumAdmin" and "MuseumUser" roles
- **FR-007**: System MUST use SQLite as the database technology
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement asynchronous programming (async/await) for all I/O-bound operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST return standard HTTP status codes consistently (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
- **FR-010**: System MUST encapsulate all business logic in injectable services (no inline logic in API routes)
- **FR-011**: System MUST configure structured logging using Serilog with TraceId and SpanId correlation
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement centralized exception handling middleware
- **FR-013**: System MUST support API versioning using URI path versioning with semantic versioning
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- **FR-015**: System MUST store application settings in appsettings.json and support environment variables

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents a museum user.  These people are unauthenticated.
- **Administrators**: represent people 
- **Authentication Context**: Manages JWT tokens, user sessions, and role-based access control
- **Administrators**: represent museum staff with elevated permissions

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Application starts and serves Blazor WASM client successfully in under 5 seconds
- **SC-002**: API endpoints respond with proper HTTP status codes and structured error responses
- **SC-003**: JWT authentication successfully protects endpoints and rejects unauthorized requests
- **SC-004**: All three projects (Client, Server, Shared) build and run without compilation errors
- **SC-005**: Swagger documentation is generated and accessible at the /swagger endpoint
- **SC-006**: Application logs include TraceId and SpanId for correlation between client and server
- **SC-007**: Database connection to SQLite is established and ready for future entity operations
- **SC-008**: API versioning is configured and endpoints are accessible with version-specific URLs
